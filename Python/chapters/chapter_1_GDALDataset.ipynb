    "## Introduction\n",
    "One of the most fundamental components of the GDAL raster library is a \"[class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming))\", or an object, that stores all of the information one might want about a raster image. This class, the `GDALDataset`, combines the information about a raster file with a few actions one might want to perform with a raster image, like reading from an image. The information stored by a class is generally referred to as \"[properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(programming))\" or attributes and the actions a class can perform are called \"[methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming))\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're coming from another language and want an overview of object oriented programming in Python, see the [Python tutorial on classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) or the [LearnPython class tutorial](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "For those wishing for a verbose, full reference to the the GDAL \"Application Programming Interface\" ([API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)), you can find the C and Python API here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [C API](http://gdal.org/python/osgeo.gdal.Dataset-class.html)\n",
    "- [Python API](http://gdal.org/python/osgeo.gdal.Dataset-class.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some class methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GetDriver`\n",
    "- `GetRasterBand`\n",
    "- `GetGeoTransform`\n",
    "- `GetProjection`\n",
    "- `GetSubDatasets`\n",
    "\n",
    "These class methods are so called \"getter\" methods that allow you to access class attributes (remember: class attributes are just variables that belong to the class). When you call the class method, `GetDriver`, the GDAL dataset will return the image format driver (e.g., ENVI driver, GeoTIFF driver, HDF driver) responsibile for handling the input and output operations for this raster file format. Similarly, the `GetGeoTransform` method will the transformation that can be used to translate between pixel coordinates and projection coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: the \"getter\" and \"setter\" class methods for accessing and settting class properties is not \"Pythonic\" - these methods exist because the API was originally written for C++ where such methods are normal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Another suite of class methods allow you to set class attributes. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SetGeoTransform`\n",
    "- `SetProjection`\n",
    "\n",
    "which allow you to modify the geographic projection and location of the image."

    "    - tools for file manipulation, command line argument parsing, and web access and parsing already exist and are robust\n",
    "    - Python already widely used in other scientific communities and outside of science for web servers, desktop applications, and server management\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Scientific Python provides very well documented and easy to use interfaces to pre-existing numeric methods\n",
    "    - Linear alebgra, classification routines, regression methods, and more have been published for decades as Fortran or C codes\n",
    "    - Libraries such as SciPy, NumPy, and SciKits wrap and extend these pre-existing codes in an easy to use package\n",
    "    - Strong machine learning and deep learning packages like keras and scikit-learn\n",

Unfortunately, some scientific packages (QGIS, for example) have not yet completed the transition away from Python 2. Unless you have good reason to use Python 2 (like if you're writing a QGIS plugin in Python), the general concensus is to recommend using Python 3."
